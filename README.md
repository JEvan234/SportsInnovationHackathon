# 2025 Sports Innovation Hackathon
The goal of this hackathon was to research and develop a solution to a problem within ~36 hours in one of three general catagories: <br>
-Fan Engagement <br>
-Gameday Operations <br>
-Athlete Experience <br>

## Our Solution:
We chose to develop a solution regarding fan engagement, and made a website that was ideally going to unify information across the many platforms KSU offers, such as ticket registration. This site was also intended to offer a rewards system, and encourage fans to attend multiple games, especially with friends. <br>

## Our Research: 
As part of the research of our solution, we sent multiple team members to a sporting events that were occuring on the same day, and asked a variety of questions to fans and staff alike to refine what our website should offer.
